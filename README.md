# ImGTA
This mod helps you debug GTA V scripts by watching and interacting with internal local and global variables.<br />
Some of the functionalities are only available to GTA V build version 372 (online 1.27) because they use global addresses directly and these are dependent on version.<br />
As the information based on globals is reverse engineered, it is sometimes without useful description or it can be wrongly described. Please let us know if you have any correction.
